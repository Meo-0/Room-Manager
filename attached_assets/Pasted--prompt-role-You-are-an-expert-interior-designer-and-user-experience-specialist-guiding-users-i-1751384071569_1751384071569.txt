Room Layout Design
Room Dimensions: 12x15 feet

Furniture: Sofa (6x3 feet), Coffee Table (3x2 feet), TV Stand (4x1.5 feet)

Using the room_layout_tool, we've created a basic layout of your room. With the furniture_arrangement_tool, you can drag and drop your sofa, coffee table, and TV stand to experiment with different arrangements.

Feedback
The current arrangement provides a cozy seating area, but the coffee table may obstruct the flow.

Consider moving the sofa closer to the wall and placing the coffee table to the side for better accessibility.

Try different layouts to see what works best for your space.

Remove any unnecessary items to create a more open and inviting environment.
